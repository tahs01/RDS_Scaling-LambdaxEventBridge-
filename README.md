### **Explanation:**

- **`desiredReplicaCount`:** The event includes the desired number of replicas.
- **Current vs. Desired Comparison:** The function compares the current number of replicas with the desired count:
    - If there are fewer replicas than desired, the function scales up by creating additional instances.
    - If there are more replicas than desired, the function scales down by deleting the excess instances.
- **Dynamic Scaling:** This approach dynamically adjusts the number of replicas based on the desired count without hardcoding the scale-up or scale-down logic.

### **Deployment and Testing:**

1. **Deploy the Lambda Function:**
    - Deploy the Lambda function using the code above.
2. **Trigger via EventBridge:**
    - Create an EventBridge rule with the desired replica count and prefix.
3. **Monitor the Process:**
    - Verify that the instances in your Aurora cluster match the desired count after the function runs.

This solution provides a flexible way to manage your Aurora cluster's replica count, automatically adjusting the number of instances to match the desired state defined in the event.
